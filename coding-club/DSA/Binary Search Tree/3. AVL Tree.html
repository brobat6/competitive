<h2>AVL Trees</h2>


<p>
An ordered tree (binary search tree) is used when we wish to store
objects with (numerical) keys in a binary tree so that
lookups can be done in order <em>log<sub>2</sub>N</em> time, where
<em>N</em> is the number of objects in the tree.
But an ordered tree that is seriously ``unbalanced,'' that is, where
paths from the root to the leaves have dramatically different
lengths, will ruin the desired lookup behavior.

</p><p>
The worst-case example of an unbalanced ordered tree is the tree
built by inserting a <em>sorted</em> sequence of objects
(we show the numerical keys only;
the objects attached with the keys are unimportant):
</p><pre>1 2 3 4
</pre>
The tree looks like this:
<pre>   1
  / \
 .   2
    / \
   .   3
      / \
     .   4
        / \
       .   .
</pre>
Obviously, a lookup in this tree is just a linear search, which is slower
than log-time.

<p>
How can we maintain an ordered tree so that, regardless of the order of
insertions, the tree remains balanced?  There are several sophisticated
technques for doing so; here we consider one of the most elegant,
<em>AVL trees</em>.

</p><h4>Definition of an AVL tree</h4>

An AVL-tree is an ordered tree that has the <em>height-balanced property.</em>
Here are the basic definitions:

<dl>
<dd>
The <em>height</em> of a tree is the length of the longest path from
the tree's root to one of its leaves.
</dd><dd>
<p>
A Node is <em>balanced</em> if the height of its left subtree is
plus-or-minus-one the height of its right subtree.
</p></dd><dd>
<p>
A binary tree has the <em>height-balanced property</em>
if all of its Nodes are balanced.
</p></dd></dl>

<p>
Here is an example of an AVL-tree, whose root holds 44:
</p><pre>          44
      /         \
    17           78
   /  \         /  \
  .   32      50    88
      / \    /  \   / \
     .   .  48  62 .  .
           / \ / \
          .  . .  .
</pre>
For clarity, we redraw the tree and write the heights next to each Node,
in parentheses:
<pre>         44(4) 
      /         \
    17(2)        78(3)
   /  \         /    \
  .  32(1)   50(2)    88(1)
      / \    /  \      / \
     .   . 48(1) 62(1) .  .
           / \   / \
          .  .  .  .
</pre>
Notice that, for every node in the tree, the heights of its subtrees
are the same, plus-or-minus one.

<p>
(By the way, the initials, ``AVL,'' denote the two Russian researchers,
G.M. Adel'son-Vel'skii and Y.M. Landis, who developed the key definitions
and algorithms for the tree format.)

</p><p>
The example shows that an AVL-tree is not ``exactly'' balanced, or
complete (like a heap), but it is ``balanced well enough''.
Here is the reason why is it is ``well enough'':

</p><dl>
<dd>
An AVL-tree with <em>N</em> nodes has a height that is <em>less than</em>
<em>(2 log<sub>2</sub>N) + 2</em>.
</dd></dl>
This implies that a lookup takes on the order of <em>log<sub>2</sub>N</em>
node comparisons.  A lookup in a complete ordered tree, where the
balancing is perfect, would take, at worst,
<em>(log<sub>2</sub>N)+1</em> comparisons.  So, an AVL-tree is only
twice as ``slow'' as the optimal ordered tree --- this is still very good!

<p>
(For example, if the tree held 2048 objects, then lookup in a complete
tree takes 12 comparisons, worst case, whereas AVL lookup takes 24
comparisons, worst case.  Linear search would take 1024 comparisons,
on average, and 2048 comparisons, in worst case.)

</p><h4>Insertion into AVL-trees: Insertion then Rotation</h4>

We must find an efficient way to do an insertion into an AVL-tree that
preserves orderedness and the height-balanced property.  Our strategy
will be to do an insertion in the usual, naive way, and then rebuild
the tree to recover the height-balanced property.
The second step is called <em>rotation</em>.

<p>
Let's reconsider the above tree and insert 54 into it.
We know how to perform insertion into ordered trees, and this gives us:
</p><pre>         44(5)! 
      /         \
    17(2)        78(4)!
   /  \         /    \
  .  32(1)   50(3)    88(1)
      / \    /  \      / \
     .   . 48(1) 62(2) .  .
           / \   /  \
          .  .  54(1) .
               /  \
              .    .
</pre>
Again, the heights are listed next to the nodes.  
The insertion of 54 has made unbalanced the two
nodes marked by <tt>!</tt> --- they do not have
the height-balanced property.  
In general, many nodes, <em>all located along the path from the
root to the insertion position</em>, might have their heights changed
and become unbalanced.
We must rebuild the tree so that the unbalanced nodes become balanced
again.

<h4>A general picture of an imbalance</h4>

Why did the above AVL tree become unbalanced?
Some careful thinking will convince us that an insertion generates
an unbalanced node when the inserted number is placed in a subtree
that is already ``full'' and already has a height that is one greater
than its sibling tree.

<p>
A general diagram of the problematic situation looks like this:
Say that an AVL tree has a subtree, Z, that has two differently
heighted subtrees, and say that the larger-height subtree, Y, is ``full'':
</p><pre>      root
     /    \
    .      .
   .        .
             Z(n+2)
           /     \
          *(n)   Y(n+1)
         / \     /  \
                *(n) *(n)
                /\   /\
</pre>
(As usual, we write the heights in parentheses next to the nodes.
Subtree <tt>Y</tt> is``full'' in the sense that both of its subtrees
have the same height, and adding one more value to a subtree will cause the 
subtree's height
to increase.)
Say that we must
insert a new number, <tt>k</tt>, and the insertion places <tt>k</tt>
inside subtree Y, and this generates an imbalance:
<pre>      root
     /    \
    .      .
   .        .
             Z(n+3)!
           /     \
          *(n)   Y(n+2)
         / \     /  \
               *(n) *(n+1)
                /\  /\
                     k
</pre>
Subtree Y is still balanced, but since its height increased by one,
this ruins Z's balance.


<h4>Rotation</h4>

The above diagram suggests that 
``too many'' objects are placed within subtree Y; perhaps we can find
a way of using some of the ``empty space'' within Z's left subtree
and reducing Y's (and Z's) height downwards by one.  If we can do
this, then we have rebalanced the tree.

<p>
Is it remarkable that we can repair the situation
by moving --- <em>rotating</em> --- not <tt>k</tt> but
the nodes above it.  Indeed, we will rotate <em>just three nodes</em>.

</p><p>
Here is the clever strategy:
</p><ol>
<li>
Locate the unbalanced node closest to the insertion point;
call it ``Node Z''.
</li><li>
Of Node Z's two subtrees, locate the subtree in which the insertion
was done and call the root of this subtree,
``Node Y.''
</li><li>
Of Node Y's two subtrees, locate the subtree in which the insertion
was done and call the root of this subtree,
``Node X.''  (Note that Node X might be the object just inserted.)
</li></ol>
For the earlier example,
we have this arrangement: Node Z holds 78,
Y holds 50, and X holds 62; here again is the example:
<pre>         44(5)!
      /         \
    17(2)      Z78(4)!
   /  \         /    \
  .  32(1)  Y50(3)    88(2)
      / \    /  \      / \
     .   .48(1) X62(2) .  .
           / \   /  \
          .  .  54(1) .
               /  \
              .    .
</pre>
Here is a more general diagram of the situation, with node heights
indicated in parentheses:
<pre>             Z(n+3)!
           /     \
          *(n)   Y(n+2)
         / \     /  \
               *(n) X(n+1)
                /\  /\
                     k
</pre>
That is, the insertion of the new object has caused Node X's height to 
increase by one, and this makes Node Y's height increase by one.
(Node that Node X might itself be the new object, and note that
Node Y is still balanced.  Hence, the heights must be related as shown.)
The result is that Node Z's height has increased from
<tt>n+2</tt> to <tt>n+3</tt> and is unbalanced.

<p>
Rather than try to move Node <tt>k</tt>, 
our objective is to rearrange
Nodes Z, Y, and X,
so that the subtree
becomes balanced again <em>and recovers the height of <tt>n+2</tt>,
which it had prior to the insertion</em>.  All three nodes might be moved,
but their subtrees, and the rest of the tree, will be unaltered.

</p><p>
Now remember that each of Nodes Z, Y, and X hold numerical values,
and remember that the three nodes are arranged in a path, a linear
sequence, in the tree, like this:
</p><pre>   Node Z
     \
    Node Y
      /
   Node X
</pre>
To reduce the height of this structure, it makes sense to rearrange
the three nodes into this pattern:
<pre>        Node b 
        /   \
   Node a   Node c
</pre>
This would reduce the height by one!
But which of Z, Y, X, should be Node b?  Node a?  Node c?

<p>
The answer is simple: We compare the values held in Nodes Z, Y, and X.
The node that holds the smallest number will be ``Node a'';
the node the holds the middle number will be ``Node b'';
and the node the holds the largest number will be ``Node c''.

</p><p>
Another way of identifying Nodes a,b, and c  is to visually ``read''
the tree from left to right; the leftmost node is Node a; the middle is Node b;
and the rightmost is Node c.  (This left-to-right ``reading'' can be
coded as an in-order tree traversal.)

</p><p>
The above picture is incomplete, because Nodes Z, Y, and X
have their own subtrees.  We must label the 
the four subtrees attached to Nodes a, b, and c,
as T0, T1, T2, and T3.  Again, we can do this by ``reading'' the tree
from left to right.

</p><p>
But here is a more precise statement of the algorithm:
Given Nodes Z, Y, and X:
</p><ol>
<li>
Attach the label, ``Node a'', to the Node that has the smallest value;
attach the label, ``Node b'', to the Node that has the middle value;
and attach the label, ``Node c'', to the Node that has the largest value;
</li><li>
Label Node a's left subtree, ``T0''.
</li><li>
If Node a's right subtree is not Node b, then label it ``T1'';
else label Node b's left subtree ``T1''.
</li><li>
If Node b's right subtree is not Node c, then label it ``T2'';
else label Node c's left subtree ``T2''.
</li><li>
Label Node c's right subtree, ``T3''.
</li></ol>

<p>
Here is the labelling for the example:
</p><pre>                 Z78c
                /    \
            Y50a      88T3
             /  \      / \
          48T0  X62b   .  .
           / \  /  \
          .  . 54T1 .T2
              /  \
              .    .
</pre>
Now, given Nodes a, b, c, 
and given subtrees T0, T1, T2, T3,
we rotate the nodes and reconnect them to their subtrees like this:
<pre>                  b
               /     \
              a       c
            /   \   /   \
           T0   T1 T2   T3
</pre>
For the example, the result of the rotation looks like this:
<pre>                  62b
                /    \
             50a       78c
             /  \      / \
          48T0  54T1  .T2 88T3
           / \  /  \      /  \
          .  . .    .    .    .
</pre>
If you carefully consider the algorithm we used to attach the labels,
a, b, and c, and T0, T1, T2, and T3, you can verify that the
rotated tree is still an ordered tree.  Further, you can visually
verify that the height of the tree has been reduced by one!

<h4>The four forms of rotation</h4>

<p>
To validate the reduction in height, we can draw diagrams of all the
possible combinations of Nodes a,b, and c  that can arise, and
we see that each rotation reduces the height of the root node by one.
There are four cases:
</p><pre>CASE 1:

   Node Z a           ==&gt;           Y
   /   \                         /     \
  T0   Node Y b                 Z       X
       /  \                    /  \    /  \
      T1  Node X c            T0  T1  T2  T3
          /  \
         T2  T3
</pre>
<pre>CASE 2:

    Node Z c           ==&gt;           Y
   /        \                     /     \
  Node Y b   T3                  X       Z
  /       \                     /  \    /  \
Node X a   T2                  T0  T1  T2  T3
 /  \
T0  T1
</pre>
<pre>CASE 3:

   Node Z a           ==&gt;           X
   /   \                         /     \
  T0   Node Y c                 Z       Y
       /    \                 /  \    /  \
 Node X b    T3              T0  T1  T2  T3
    /  \
   T1  T2
</pre>
<pre>CASE 4:

    Node Z c           ==&gt;           X
   /        \                     /     \
 Node Y a   T3                  Y       Z
 /       \                     /  \    /  \
T0    Node X b                T0  T1  T2  T3
        /  \
       T1  T2
</pre>


<h4>Node deletion from an AVL-tree</h4>


<p>
The basic idea: as before, consider a node deletion 
as the deletion of the root (of a subtree).
Replace the deleted root by an ``innermost'' node, as described in the
lecture on ordered trees.

</p><p>
The promotion of the innermost node to the root might make one half of the
rebuilt tree too shallow and unbalance the tree, and
(repeated) rotations might be needed to repair the problem.
The rotations would proceed along the path from the location of the
former innermost node to the root of the overall tree.

</p><p>
So, starting from the leaf that replaced the promoted innermost node,
search along the path from the leaf to the overall root, examining
each node to see if it is unbalanced.  If an unbalanced node
is located, call it Node Z.

</p><p>
We must revise the
definition of the Y-X-nodes:
</p><ol>
<li>
Of Node Z's two subtrees, locate the subtree with the greater height
and call the root of this subtree,
``Node Y.''
</li><li>
Of Node Y's two subtrees, locate the subtree with the greater height
and call the root of this subtree,
``Node X.'' (If both subtrees have the same height, then choose either one.)
</li></ol>

Now, the rotation proceeds as before.

<p>
Unfortunately, additional rotations might be necessary, so the
technique is repeated for the parent node of the newly installed
rotated root, and its parent, etc., until the root of the entire
tree is balanced.
Although this is more work, there are at most on the order of
<em>log<sub>2</sub>N</em> rotations, so the deletion operation
is relatively efficient.
